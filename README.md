</h1>

Run any arbitrary python script every time the code changes in the file.

## installation

Get the package from PyPI with `pip3 install hotreload`.

## warning

You shouldn't do this and this can have [unexpected, unintended](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23516018) repurcusions. Proceed with caution, you have been warned!

## usage

Say you have script (`script.py`) that you want to run every time the code
changes in that file.

To do that, it is as simple as doing this:

```python
import time
import logging
from hotreload import Loader


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    script = Loader("script.py")

    while True:
        # Check if script has been modified since last poll.
        if script.has_changed():
            # Execute a function from script if it has been modified.
            script.main()

        time.sleep(1)
```
